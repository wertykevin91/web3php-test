## Installation on Windows
Installing on windows is a pain in the a**
Naturally, this is only applicable to me, or anyone that has a similar setup.
You'll need
- Install IIS
- Install python
- Install Web Platform Installer
- Use Web Platform Installer & install the php 7.1+
- Install Composer
- Install OpenSSL for Windows
- add path to System Env for OPENSSL_CONF pointing to openssl.cnf somewhere in the bin folder of the installation folder
- add php_gmp.dll to php.ini

Don't think I miss anything here. Just my personal notes.
